Interactive simple game using the HTML5 canvas.

You shoot the green ball with a certain angle and velocity. The angle of the white line
represents the shooting anglel and the length of the line the magnitue of the velocity. You
control the line with the mouse. 

The goal of the game is hitting the red box as many as possible. The red box is moving between
the center of the screen to the right corner on the bottom at a constant speed. When the ball
hits the box, you get 10 points and the score will be updated. Then the ball will be repositioned
at the left-bottom corner again.

If you miss the box three times, the game is over.
